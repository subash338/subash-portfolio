                        <h2>EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN</h2>
                        <P>
                            An Emergency Response Plan (ERP) outlines procedures to follow in case of workplace
                            emergencies, ensuring a coordinated and effective response to protect employees, assets, and
                            operations. Key components of an ERP include:<br>

                        <h4> 1.Risk Assessment and Identification of Potential Emergencies:</h4>

                        Identify possible emergency scenarios (e.g., fire, chemical spill, natural disaster).

                        Evaluate the potential impact on employees, equipment, and facilities.<br>



                        <h4>2.Define Roles and Responsibilities:</h4>

                        Designate an Emergency Response Team (ERT) and assign roles (e.g., evacuation warden, first
                        aider, communication officer).

                        Ensure all team members are trained in their responsibilities and response procedures.<br>



                        <h4>3.Establish Evacuation Procedures:</h4>

                        Design and communicate evacuation routes and assembly points.

                        Post clear maps showing exits and assembly areas in visible locations.<br>



                        <h4> 4.Develop Communication Protocols:</h4>

                        Determine methods for alerting employees during an emergency (e.g., alarms, announcements).

                        Set up a system for notifying emergency services and providing updates to management and
                        staff.<br>



                        <h4> 5.Provide Emergency Equipment:</h4>

                        Stock and maintain emergency equipment such as fire extinguishers, first aid kits, and
                        emergency lighting.

                        Ensure all employees know the locations and proper use of this equipment.
